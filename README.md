# Cross Selling Prediction Model

An Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers want to find out whether the policyholders from past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.

Therefore, the aim of this project is to build a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance. This is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.

Since the dataset is inbalanced, finding the best model has requested to approach different strategies (such as oversampling, undersampling, ...)

The output is saved in a file named `test_with_response.csv`, which contains the ID of the customers and the associated response as predicted by the model.
